            <h3>Arf! Barley needs help finding his forever home</h3>
            <p>Barley is an incredibly sweet, playful, and goofy little guy with huge heart and a wonderful personality. Born a humble street puppy in Guatemala, he traveled a long way to the Bay Area, where he's discovered that he really needs a quieter lifestyle and environment than he's had so far in busy San Francisco.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Fluffy, plushy toys</li>
              <li>Long walks on the beach (yes, literally)</li>
              <li>Meeting and greeting other doggos - he loves to make new puppy pals and is great with other dogs!</li>
              <li>Curling up at your feet for naps and pats</li>
              <li>Taking a weirdly long time to eat a small carrot</li>
              <li>Playing with puzzle toys (especially tricky food dispensing ones!)</li>
              <li>Being with his favorite people</li>
              <li>So much more! When Barley's in the right environment, his tail is always waggin' away.</li>

            <h3>Barley's special requests</h3>
            <p>Barley is, at his core, a *very* good boy who desperately wants to please. However, he has some pretty meaningful anxiety that is particularly exacerbated by his currently loud and unpredictable urban environment. He's manifested his stress with mild separation anxiety that we've had good success working though so far, though he can experience setbacks when he's feeling acute anxiety, most of which is directly related to scary things outside like buses and moving trucks overwhelming him.</p>
            <p>He's also wary of new people, and can be barky and growly when new folks enter the house for the first time. On one occasion, Barley was particularly overwhelmed and gave a visitor a warning nip. We strongly feel that with continued training and a less stressful home location, Barley can surpass these issues and be the affectionate, wonderful pup he truly wants to be all the time.</p>
