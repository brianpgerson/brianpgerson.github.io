            What...what is this? 
          </p>
          <br />.
          <br />..
          <br />.
          <br />...
          <br />....
          <br />..
          <p>
            Where are we?
          </p>
          <br />.
          <br />...
          <br />...
          <p>
            Is this....cyberspace?
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems so. It seems, somehow...GSPN has been <em>transported to the cyber realm!</em> 
          </p>
          <p>
            Digital ecstacy! No longer constrained to the dusty backoffices of the GSPN building...free from the tedium of <em>HUMAN TIME</em>...the analysts are now pure computational beings, existing in the flow of bits and bytes, yes — even your humble reporter now courses the information superhighway at cyberspeed. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Eons-worth of human knowledge at our digital fingertips...yet I only hunger for one thing...<em><b>Fantasy Football Analysis!</b></em>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us begin.
          </p>
          <h1>MATCHUP OF THE WEEK</h1>
          <h3>OPPONENTS: Manuel Carrillo, Ryan Lerner</h3>
          <p>
            Given our newfound powers, we find it unnecessary to interview the managers for this matchup. We can trace their digital signatures and learn all we need to know. For example, Manny "The Mannyger" Carrillo may seem like he's being crafty by leaving his RB spot unfilled—will Tevin Coleman play? Will he pray that Cam Akers gets close enough to the football to smell the leather this week?—but the reality is darker. Yes, it seems that Manuel's online presence...shifted, just a few short weeks ago, when he began spending hours upon hours playing a <em>different</em> game...Fifa 2021. (We scoured the source code of the newly released blockbuster and found that it hasn't actually changed since 2019, when they made defending players 15% slower to "make the gameplay more realistic", but our job is not to analyse EA Sports games. No, it is to analyse FANTASY FOOTBALL.) What we can say is, after a blistering 3-0 start to the season, since week 4 (when Fifa 21 was released), Manuel has not won a single matchup. Is he neglecting his managerial duties?
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, one could also point to other factors. Injured core players like Raheem Mostert, along with a bench thinner than the basis for BJC's latest team name, meant that starting in week 4, Manny was starting the likes of Jeff Wilson Jr on purpose. Surprise goose-eggs, a crushing early bye week schedule, and lingering injury problems make Manny's starting roster one of the most variable sets of players from week to week in the league, which is a surefire indicator of trouble for a squad.
          </p>
          <p>But we know the truth. It's the videogames. No data is safe from the eyes of our <em><b>CYBER ANALYSTS</b></em></p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            What of Coach Lerner? We dove into his digital signature as well, but the findings were too frightening to relay here. We'll uh, we'll just stick to football, shall we?
          </p>
          <p>
            He has the same record at 3 wins, 4 losses, but the story here is different as can be, with a total points per week averaging at just 116 per week to Manny's 131. Analysis of the roster reveals what *should* be a stronger matchup for the Texas team, with only one player injured and one on bye, but one of those is at the notoriously shallow TE spot, forcing a start from 7%-rostered, 1%-started Irv Smith Jr. - not good — and the other is Chris Godwin, arguably the best receiver of the team when he can start. Even these losses don't quite explain it: this squad just hasn't gelled this year. With a league-leading three different sub-100 losses (and one of only two sub-90 results), it's been rough sledding all year. GSPN analysts just sent some messages from the cyber ether, and when properly decoded using a SHA-256 reverse hashing algorithm, they revealed the following advice: Coach Lernier could turn this season around yet by trading from his strength at WR for more startable depth. But not in time for this week.
          </p>
          <h3>THE OFFICIAL LINE: Manny, -2</h3>
          <p>
            Analysts have been crunching compute cycles at alarming speeds to try and come to a conclusion on this matchup. Power outages have been reported across the Eastern seaboard where our new home servers are kept, putting major dams and other critical infrastructure at risk as we've flooded the wires with packets of sweet, sweet data. One noteworthy pattern emerged: both of these teams are truly scraping the bottom of the barrel for this week's starting rosters. The average starting percentage (across Yahoo fantasy football) for a player on Coach Lerndobbler's squad was 53%. For The Mannyger, the average is only 58%. Top-tier teams in the league this season seem to average closer to 70%. The wisdom of the crowd isn't always correct, but in cases like these, it seems pretty clear that this is a tale of two desperate squads looking to just stay within striking distance of a crowded playoff bubble. But given the truly dire straights of Manuel's bench and lack of a playable RB option, GSPN analysts have landed on the following, nail-bitingly close prediction:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Manny: <b>117.6</b></li>
            <li>Lerndophelous: <b>114.2</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Last week, we guessed BJC: 130.69, MOLK: 116.42. The final result was MOLK: 110.5, BJC: 79.8. Guess Beej really doesn't like being the overdog afterall. Nevermind that we were wrong...that was before we ascended to the digital realm.
